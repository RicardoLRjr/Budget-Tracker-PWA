 ## Installation Instructions:
 This application does not require installation, as you can just navigate to the included website, which is hosted on heroku. 

 ## Usage Instructions:
Upon page load, the user will be shown a page with a form where they can either add or subtract funds in a specific transaction. Once the User has added or subtracted funds, they can then see the updated version of the budget tracking chart and a list of recent transactions. 

In addition, if the user is offline when they update the tracker (as is often possible when traveling) their updates to budget will be stored in local storage and uploaded to the backend database upon reestablishing internet connectivity.
